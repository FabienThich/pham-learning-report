I left some questions for him to finish by himself and will check answers with him next class.

For math, following up last lesson, we practiced a few questions of addition and subtraction to make sure he has no problems with them. But he forgot how to do ""borrowing"" subtractions, so we did a few practice questions before we started learning the concept of multiplication. We started by learning 3+3+3+3= 3x4 / 2+2+2= 2x3. After some practice, Evan started understanding this concept. We also learned x 1 and x 0 and did some practice questions.

In English, Jayden successfully constructed sentences using randomly provided words. He also began a “fill in the blanks” worksheet but completed only half a page.

Week 2:
Jayden completed another single-page worksheet on two-digit addition. Regrouping continued to be a challenge, but with guidance, he showed improvement and was able to apply the concept more accurately.
For English, he worked on identifying common and proper nouns through a fill-in-the-blanks activity and completed the full worksheet.

Week 3:
Jayden made significant progress in math, completing a page and a quarter of two-digit addition problems. He demonstrated a clear understanding of when regrouping was necessary and applied it effectively throughout the worksheet.
In English, he worked on identifying nouns from a list of words, completing over two pages with high accuracy. This was his most productive and confident week.

As Evan could do simple divisions independently, we moved on to learn how to do division with remainders. He was able to do a few practice questions independently after explanation with examples. He has good progress with math.

For language, we started with practising 'sh' and 'r' sound words. We practised with a new set of words from school today. Evan has steady progress in pronouncing 'sh' and 'r'. Then, we learned about different 'parts of speech', like nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Evan was asked to identify the different parts of speech in a sentence. It is important fundamental blocks of writing sentences. It was quite challenging for Evan to distinguish the different between them. So it took some time to show Evan the definitions of each and lots of examples. Lastly, we practised forming sentences. Evan was told every sentence has to have noun+verb. He created sentences and was asked to self-correct them. E.g. 'I so excited', we corrected the sentence by adding a verb 'am'.

For language, we reviewed parts of speech we learned last week. Evan was able to give examples of nouns, verbs and adjectives. To build foundations of sentence structure, we learned to identify subjects in a sentence today. And we moved on to subject-verb agreement, eg. The cow eats grass, mom cooks, the girls talk loudly.

He is improving everytime that I work with him. Today I introduced Jayden the 3 digits plus 2 digits, and he finished the worksheet without any further questions. However, when we moved on with English, his writing was still messy and he refused to fix it when I requested. The words were not in one line and sometimes he confused with the spacing and similar letters ( b&d, n&h). When I pointed out, he knows that he made mistakes and willing to fix those. That being said, Jayden did a very good job, this is one of the time that he actually did the work by himself without his toys. I’m confident that he can improve more in English and especially in Math. We will need to work more with the writing, but it’s totally possible to change.

We learned it step-by-step and gradually Evan knows how to find the answers accurately following the steps. We did a lot of practice on this to make sure Evan remembers the steps. We also started learning about time and time intervals towards the end of the math session. We learned about the different units to talk about time (e.g. seconds, minutes, hours). We also learned how to tell time in 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

For language, we practised reading sh and r sounds. And we took a long time correct Evan’s pronunciation on ‘really’. He always says ‘we-we’ and has difficulty pronouncing the ‘l’ sound. I taught him a method to practise the pronunciation and asked him to practise by himself when he has time. We continued from what we left off last week, about subject-verb agreement. We did a fill-in-the-blanks practice, choosing the correct verb and write it in the correct form.

Evan was able to solve the questions independently, sometimes with careless mistakes, but he has shown great learning progress in Math.

For Language,  we learn a new grammar item ""this that these those"". It is new to Evan, but he was able to understand after I showed him some real life examples and we completed some fill-in-the-blanks exercise. He was able to answer them correctly. Next, we reviewed present continuous tense briefly and talked about future tense briefly. The main focus was past tense today. We learned how to change basic word forms into past tense, e.g. cook -> cooked, play -> played). We started spelling irregular past tense verbs e.g. sit -> sat, drive -> drove etc) We will keep on learning and spelling new irregular past tense forms in upcoming lessons, to prepare Evan for writing sentences in past tense.

1/18/2026 12:18:04,Evan,,"We began the session with language work. Evan brought sentence-writing homework from school, which contained several grammatical and spelling errors. I supported Evan by helping him correct the sentences, highlighting common errors such as the differences between “than” and “then” and “thing” and “think.” This process required time, as multiple grammar concepts were involved. For each grammar point, I provided clear explanations and examples to support Evan’s understanding. After completing the homework, we chose to focus on one of the grammar items involved in Evan's writing and learned about comparative adjectives using the “-er than” structure and practised forming sentences (e.g., The tortoise is slower than the rabbit. Sally’s hair is longer than Peter’s hair.).

Toward the end of the language session, we practised reading words containing both “r” and “l,” as Evan continues to find these sounds challenging (e.g., really, relative). I broke the words down into smaller parts to support pronunciation practice. Evan showed some hesitation and lacked confidence, as he was worried about making mistakes. I reassured him that making mistakes is part of learning and provided consistent encouragement. We practised reading the words slowly together, and he showed slight improvement. Ongoing and regular practice—both in and outside of class—is recommended, especially for frequently used words such as “really.”

For Math, we continued working on division, specifically 3-digit ÷ 1-digit problems. Evan made some errors initially, so we reviewed the steps carefully and clarified the underlying concepts. We then practised multiple division questions for consolidation, and Evan was able to solve them accurately by the end of the session but took some time for each question because he forgot part of the times table. We will have to use some time next class to review times table again.

Evan is making good progress in Math; however, he is currently behind in language, so we allocated more time to language learning.",hiennguyen_love@yahoo.ca,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DAGMgbqSH7O2sLbYCb5McXwzDZvmFUAg, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HnfUR5YcEdQV-RQ0tZlG8lbfITYdKujn, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xrF-0bMq_ogxtweZ32jBp3NngkKeN7SN, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HgnNjZWV0UfQeQPxKDEtwcjhXYFDEiXI",7,

We then moved on to learning how to count and calculate elapsed time, using real-life daily examples to help consolidate his understanding. Although we had briefly introduced the calendar in previous lessons, today we focused on memorizing the names and sequence of the months. A “Months of the Year” song was used to support his learning, and we also learned a helpful trick to remember the number of days in each month, especially whether it is a long (31 days) or (short (30 days) month. We briefly reviewed division so Evan has regular practice with it. He has been doing a great job with division so far.

For language, we practised reading words with the sounds “r,” “l,” and ""sh.” The word “really”is still challenging for Evan, so we spent extra time practising it. We then continued working on past tense, reviewing the spelling of the past tense words learned last week and did fill-in-the-blanks worksheet to practise changing the verbs into past tense. Evan remembered the spelling of the past tense verbs when asked word by word. However, when we applied it to sentences, he could not remember or apply things he learned and needed help for each question we did. We will have to work on that next class.
